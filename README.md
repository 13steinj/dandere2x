## What is Dandere2x

Dandere2x speeds up the time needed to upscale animation (sometimes live-action) videos by applying compression techniques. Just as Netflix uses compression to quickly stream videos to your home, Dandere2x uses compression to make quickly upscale videos using waifu2x. 

## Current Features

- Block Matching Video Compression
- Interpolated Frame Video Compression
- Minimum / Maximum quality loss (set by JPEG standards)
- Color fading (fade to black) 
- FFMPEG Customizability 
- Interactive GUI

## FAQ

Q: What is the difference between Dandere2x and Video2x?

A: Video2x aims for quality over speed. If you're looking for the best-possible looking video, Video2x is more streamlined and provides lossless upscaling. Dandere2x, on the other hand, is still in development, is (can) much faster than video2x, but at the cost of being lossy.
