# Dandere2x - Faster Waifu2x Video Upscaling


## What is Dandere2x? 

Dandere2x is a lossy video upscaler also built around waifu2x, but with video compression techniques to shorten the time needed to process a video.

In other words, although lossy, dandere2x dramaticlly speeds up the time to process a video.

## Current Features

- Block Matching Video Compression

- Interpolated Frame Video Compression

- Minimum / maximum quality loss

- Custom block sizes

- Custom scaling sizes (1x, 2x, 3x).

## Development Status

Dandere2x is written natively on ubuntu Linux but is ported and released on windows. I hope to have an official Linux release soon, but for the time being the windows version is easier to configure.

The project is currently in alpha right now and is ready for testing (windows).

I highly recommend subscribing / checking reddit.com/r/dandere2x. I tend to be more active on there, as well as responding to PM's if problems come up .
