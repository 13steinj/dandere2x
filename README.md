## What is Dandere2x

Dandere2x makes upscaling videos with waifu2x much faster by applying compression techniques. In other words, Dandere2x uses techniques used from video streaming (such as Youtube or Netflix) to decrease the time needed to upscale a video using Waifu2x. 

## Current Features

- Block Matching Video Compression
- Interpolated Frame Video Compression
- Minimum / maximum quality loss (set by JPEG standards)
- Color fading (fade to black) 
- Custom block sizes
- Custom scaling sizes (1x, 2x, 3x)
- Interactive GUI

## FAQ

Q: What is the difference between Dandere2x and Video2x?

A: Video2x aims for quality over speed. If you're looking for the best-possible looking video, Video2x is more streamlined and provides lossless upscaling. Dandere2x, on the other hand, is still in development, is (can) much faster than video2x, but at the cost of being lossy.
